# ImgShot v1.0.1

**ImgShot** is an *open source image hosting service*.  
It has been created on July 26, 2014.

This the first version of KeyGen, made using pure PHP source code: without any framework behind it.  
ImgShot v2 is available and work along with [Oli](https://github.com/OliFramework/Oli), an open source PHP framework made by [myself](https://github.com/matiboux/).

### Start using it

**You use the service directly with the official ImgShot v1: https://data.matiboux.com/imgshot/.**

You can also host your own version on your webserver.  
[Download the latest release](https://github.com/matiboux/ImgShot-v1/releases/latest), extract the files and put them on your web server. Once this is all done, open your browser and type the URL to your hosted ImgShot.

**Enjoy uploading your images!**
